/* Instructions:
For this assignment you will implement a class called Person.

 Each person has some number of marbles and some number of children.

 Implement a function in the Person class called SumMarbles that returns the total number of marbles a person has in addition to the total number of marbles of all of the Personâ€™s descendants (hint: they're people, like soylent green).

 In an Android application, place the results inside of a TextView. You may debug as needed.

 In the example below, each circle represents a person, each number inside the circle represents the number of marbles each person has. The numbers in green show the expected output of the SumMarbles function applied to each person.
