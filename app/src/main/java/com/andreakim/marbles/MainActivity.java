/* Instructions:
For this assignment you will implement a class called Person.

 Each person has some number of marbles and some number of children.

 Implement a function in the Person class called SumMarbles that returns the total number of marbles a person has in addition to the total number of marbles of all of the Personâ€™s descendants (hint: they're people, like soylent green).

 In an Android application, place the results inside of a TextView. You may debug as needed.

 In the example below, each circle represents a person, each number inside the circle represents the number of marbles each person has. The numbers in green show the expected output of the SumMarbles function applied to each person.
________________________________________________________
p1 has 10 marbles, 32 including all his children's
p2,3,4 are children of p1

p2 has 1 marble, but 6 including his children's marbles
p5,6 are his children
p5 has 2 marbles and no children
p6 has 3 marbles and no children
___
p3 has 5 marbles and no children
___
p4 has 7 marbles of his own and 11 including those of his children
p7 is child of p4
p7 has 4 marbles and no children
________________________________________________________

p7 = 4 + 0 = 4
p4 = p7(4) + 7 = 11
p3 = 5 + 0 = 5
p2 = 1 + p5(2) + p6(3) = 6
p5 = 2 + 0 = 2
p6 = 3 + 0 = 3
p1 = 10 + p2(6) + p3(5) + p4(7) = 32
